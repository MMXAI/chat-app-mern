# Code Documentation Setup Using "jsdoc":

## Install VSCode Extension "JSDoc Generator"

## Use this syntax for jsdoc Documentation
    /**
    * This is a jsdoc comment
    */

    Look at backend/jsdoc-example/
    This folder illustrates how to put jsdoc comments
    on your javascript project codebase.
    Also it shows how to setup a hand-crafted tutorial
    about your project.

    Also look at frontend/src/App.jsx
    This is an example of putting jsdoc comments on
    React components (which are infact js functions)

## Note that we have two "package.json" files.
   chat-app-mern/package.json:
        This is for backend package management.
   chat-app-mern/frontend/package.json:
        This one is for frontend package management.
   So infact our mega project (fullstack chat-app-mern) 
   consists of two separate & independent projects 
   (frontend & backend).
   So for better control on documentation, it is recommended
   to setup jsdoc for frontend project and backend project
   independently, as is done here.

## Backend Documentation (chat-app-mern/):
1. npm i -D jsdoc
2. Setup your config in jsdoc.json
3. (optional) add jsdoc command to package.json
4. npm run doc 
    (your docs are generated)

## Frontend Documentation (chat-app-mern/frontend/):
1. cd into frontend folder (chat-app-mern/frontend/)
2. Do all the steps as you did in "Backend Documentation"
    (Attention: jsdoc.json is a bit different here!)

## Enabling Options and Customization
1. Activate "checkJs" to enable type checking (settings.json)
    (Now your code compliance with your jsdoc 
     types and definitions is always checked)
2. npm i -D docdash
   Then setup your config in "jsdoc.json" to use docdash theme
